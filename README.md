# University-Rankings
## Project Summary 
This project analyzes global university rankings, focusing on the impact of research performance (publications, influence, and broad impact) on university rankings. Using data from the CWUR (Center for World University Rankings) for the years 2012-2015, we aim to understand which factors contribute most to rankings and how research output influences performance.

## Key Questions
What factors most significantly influence global university rankings?
How does research output (publications, influence, broad impact) correlate with university rankings?
Do universities with higher research output consistently achieve better rankings?
How can universities improve their rankings by focusing on research development?
What are the main differences between high-ranked, mid-tier, and developing universities based on their research performance?

## Project Structure

The analysis is divided into six Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

- Exploratory Analysis
- Exploring Relationships
- Geographical Analysis
- Machine Learning: Regression
- Machine Learning: Clustering
- Time Series Analysis
